**SafariTech Solutions — Enterprise Network Lab**

**Overview**

This lab models **SafariTech's HQ network**: a small enterprise topology with clear separation of duties (Engineering vs Sales), a Layer‑3 core switch performing inter‑VLAN routing (SVIs), trunked access switches, and external router links to simulate upstream/ISP connectivity.

It intentionally goes beyond a classroom exercise — the configuration is written as if this were a real deployment: **secure management, authenticated routing, useful documentation** and **verifiable tests**. Think of it as a short, demonstrable portfolio piece for a networking engineer role.


**Topology (at a glance)**


Core: 3560 L3 Core Switch (SVIs, OSPF area 0, management, hardened)

Access: Two 2960 access switches (Engineering & Sales)

Router: Edge router simulating ISP links and participating in **OSPF**

**Departments & subnets**

**Engineering (VLAN 10)** — 10.10.10.0/24 — SVI 10.10.10.1

**Sales (VLAN 20)** — 20.10.10.0/24 — SVI 20.10.10.1

**Trunk links** between Core ↔ Access (802.1Q), access ports to end hosts


**What I built (features & rationale)**


**VLAN segmentation & SVIs** — isolates broadcast domains and places inter‑VLAN routing on the L3 core for performance and manageability.

**Trunking** — 802.1Q trunks on distribution links to carry multiple VLANs cleanly.

**OSPF routing** — area 0 used for core routing; simple, industry‑typical design.

**OSPF MD5 authentication** — demonstrates secure routing protocol practice (protects against rogue routers and accidental adjacency).

**SSH v2 + local user auth** — secure out‑of‑band management; service password-encryption to avoid plain text on the console.

**Device hardening** — MOTD banner, exec-timeout, disabled unused ports, descriptive interface naming.

**Documentation-friendly configs** — commented CLI blocks, consistent naming, and verification commands to make the configuration hireable and maintainable.


**Networking Keypoints** 


Design decision: "I chose **SVIs** on the L3 switch rather than ROAS for lower latency and higher throughput at the distribution layer."

Security posture: "I used **MD5** for OSPF authentication and **SSH-only vty access** to harden management paths."

Operational readiness: "Configs include interface descriptions, banners, and basic hardening to reflect a production mindset."

Troubleshooting readiness: "I validated connectivity and built verification steps so issues can be triaged quickly."


**Skills Showcased**

Advanced Cisco IOS configuration **(routing, switching, security)**

**Subnetting & IP design** for enterprise-grade networks

Secure network deployment with industry best practices

Troubleshooting and verification (**ping, traceroute, show commands**)

Strong pragmatism and creativity in handling complex topologies


**Why This Project Matters**

This topology is more than a lab – it reflects my ability to design, configure, and secure enterprise-class networks. It proves my readiness for roles in network engineering, infrastructure design, and network security.
